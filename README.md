# SOTU

State of the Union Text Data Mining

### Running these notebooks

I use Docker and the jupyter/datascience-notebook for this.
First open a terminal window and run the install_packages.sh script
which will install the necessary conda and R packages.

Then load the Data notebook to download the texts.

After that you can run the other notebooks in any order.
